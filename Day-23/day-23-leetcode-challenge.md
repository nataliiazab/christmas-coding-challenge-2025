## Minimum depth of a binary tree - Task

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

```js
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

```js
Example 2:
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

```js
Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

```js
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^5].
The value of each node is in the range [-1000, 1000].

```
